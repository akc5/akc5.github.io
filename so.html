				<h3>Answer to SO question - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76944499/why-is-hugepage-memory-considered-as-used-and-not-free-or-available</h3>
				Allocated hugepages are a memory management feature used in certain operating systems, particularly in Linux, to improve memory performance for applications that require 
				large amounts of contiguous memory. These hugepages are larger than the regular memory pages used in virtual memory management. 
				The primary goal of using hugepages is to reduce memory fragmentation, increase memory access speed, and improve the overall efficiency of memory-intensive applications.

When hugepages are allocated, they are indeed set aside for specific applications that have requested them. However, there are a few reasons why these allocated hugepages might show up as "used" memory rather than "available" or "free":

<h3>Memory Reservation:</h3> Hugepages are usually pre-allocated and reserved for specific applications or system services during boot time or application initialization. 
This reservation ensures that the required amount of contiguous memory is available for these applications. 
Since these pages are reserved for specific purposes, they are marked as "used" because they are dedicated to those applications.

<h3>Hugepage Pool Management:</h3> In systems using Transparent Huge Pages (THP), the Linux kernel manages a pool of hugepages that can be dynamically allocated to applications when needed. 
When an application requests a certain number of hugepages, the kernel allocates them from this pool. 
The pool itself is considered a resource, and the allocated pages are tracked as part of this resource pool. 
As a result, even though the hugepages are not actively used by applications, they are considered "used" within the context of this resource pool.

<h3>Kernel Bookkeeping</h3>: The Linux kernel maintains a record of allocated resources, including hugepages, for accounting and management purposes. 
This record-keeping ensures that the system is aware of the resources that are committed to applications and prevents overallocation. 
This information may be presented as "used" memory in various system monitoring tools.

<h3>Kernel Address Space</h3>: The Linux kernel has its own virtual address space separate from user processes. 
Allocated hugepages are often within the kernel's address space, and the kernel might consider them "used" because they are allocated and accounted for within its memory management.

In summary, allocated hugepages are indeed reserved for specific applications or system use, and they are tracked and managed by the operating system's memory management subsystem. 
This tracking often leads to them being categorized as "used" memory rather than "available" or "free" because they are committed resources within the system's memory infrastructure. 
It's important to understand the context in which memory is categorized and to consider the specific memory management mechanisms of the operating system being used.
