				Prerequisites:
				A transport protocol with following data stream charateristics - 
				1. Reliable
				2. In order

				TLS provides the following for communication between 2 peers - 
				1. Authentication: communicating peers can authenticate each other to verify they are talking to the right person.
				2. Confidentiality: no one else is listening to the conversation.
				3. Integrity: communication data between peers cannot be altered without detection.

				TLS consists of 2 main components:
				1. A handshake protocol: negotiate and reach an agreement on what all is required to secure the communication.
				2. A record protocol: use the agreed upon specs from 1 to secure communication.
