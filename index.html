				<h3>TLS</h3>
					Prerequisites:
					A transport protocol with following data stream charateristics - 
					1. Reliable
					2. In order

					TLS provides the following for communication between 2 peers - 
					1. Authentication: communicating peers can authenticate each other to verify they are talking to the right person.
					2. Confidentiality: no one else is listening to the conversation.
					3. Integrity: communication data between peers cannot be altered without detection.

					TLS consists of 2 main components:
					1. A handshake protocol: negotiate and reach an agreement on what all is required to secure the communication.
					2. A record protocol: use the agreed upon specs from 1 to secure communication.

					<h3>Getting Started With AI</h3>
					What is AI ?
					On a broader level the goal of AI can be thought of as the ability to mimic human capabilities.
					Calculations, assertions and reasoning, social interactions, etc are some of many human capabilities.

					There are different types of AI based on what kind of tasks they focus at, for eg:
					1. Machine Learning - Enables a machine to make deductions based on patterns.
					2. Neural Networks - Mimic a human brain like functions; take inferences and results and use them to derive some logic or rationale.
					3. Deep Learning - Use knowledge and learnings to perform some generic task(s).

					<h3>Data Structures</h3>
					Contiguous data structures - Continuous slabs of memory, eg: arrays, heaps, etc.
					Linked data structures - chunks of memory bound together by pointers, likned list, trees, etc.

					Arrays
					1. Advantages: Constant time access, no record info needed, contiguous nature helps exploit the cache.
					2. Disadvantages: Fixed size allowes for limited elements and might require expansion to allow more elements in the array.
