				<h3>Setting up a local DNS server.</h3>
				1. To setup a local DNS server we need to add an entry in the file /etc/hosts for the domain name that we want to resolve.
				2. Lets use a domain name - www.localhost.com, for test purpose.
				3. Add the following entry to your /etc/hosts file - 
					127.0.0.1	www.localhost.com
				4. Save and close the file.
				5. Run <label><hlt>nslookup www.localhost.com</hlt></label> on the shell and that should give you the following output -
					Server:         127.0.0.53
					Address:        127.0.0.53#53

					Non-authoritative answer:
					Name:   www.localhost.com
					Address: 127.0.0.1
DONE
